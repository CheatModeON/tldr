       <h1>More than just summary!</h1>
       <p class="lead"> Most approaches you find today on the internet offer you a summary that is created from the most valued sentences on a given text.
Our approach, however, is implementing <b>state of the art</b> Deep Neural Network algorithms that create new sentences.
Those sentences make sense and are as if a human wrote them.</p>

          <h2>Why summarize</h2>
          <p><ul>
              <li>Save time reading the whole thing</li>
              <li>Avoid trash articles and clickbait</li>
              <li>There are a lot of little details that distract from the main point</li>
              <li>To extract the main idea</li>
              <li>It does not give you the key points or the most valuable sentences</li>
              <li>It summarises the content of texts like a human would do</li>
              <li>It can be used a tool of recreation of sentences since it avoids plagiarism and repetition of sentences used in the given text</li>
              <li>Provide functionality for people with disabilities. e.g. some person is unable to read the whole text, however, he can listen to the synopsis</li>
